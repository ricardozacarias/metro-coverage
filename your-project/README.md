# Abstract
Statistical and probabilistic quantification of metro systems in different cities. Created an algorithm to estimate three separate geographical metrics that evaluate the coverage and availability of points of interest within a city:

1.  Average distance to the closest station from random points within the city the limits;
2. The number of metro stations within a 1km radius of random points;
3. Percentage of metropolitan area covered by metro stations.

Subway systems were subsequently ranked based on these metrics and the difference between them was tested statistically. The location intelligence applications of this project are exemplified by the use of geolocation data for the Portuguese bakery  *A Padaria Portuguesa*. Furthermore, I demonstrate that demographical data can be easily layered on the algorithm. 



# Introduction
I wanted to work with public transportation data, but as I was doing research on which were considered to be the best metro systems in the world, it was very difficult to find any article that used quantitative measures. The majority of internet posts rank metro systems based on the design or the cleanliness of its underground stations.  



# Datasets
The data required for this project was foraged from many different corners of the internet. Here are their locations.
